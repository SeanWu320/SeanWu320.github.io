I'm a first-year ECE PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, supervised by [Prof. Vladimir Dvorkin](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dvorkin/). My major research interest include electricity market, power system cyber security and data privacy. I recieved my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology and my B.Eng degree in Electrical Engineering at North China Electric Power University.
